Differential Selection Scores for the 1000 Genomes Populations
-Scores obtained using SISTR (Selection Inference at Short Tandem Repeats)
--A method to estimate selection coefficients at each STR in the genome

Explanation of column headers:
Note: In the files, 'x' is replaced by the population name abbreviation (e.g. CEU, CHB, YRI)

chrom: chromosome number
start: starting position of locus
end: ending position of locus
period: number of base pairs in the repeat motif (e.g. period 2 refers to dinucleotides)
motif: repeat motif
x_optimal_ru: number of repeat units in optimal allele (most frequent allele length in population)
x_s_val: median of posterior distribution of s obtained from ABC
x_95%_CI: 95% confidence interval of posterior distribution of s obtained from ABC
x_p_val: p value obtained using a likelihood ratio test
diff_score_med: difference between the s values (median of the posterior distribution) of the two populations 
diff_score_ci: difference between the 95% CIs of the two populations 
    -calculated as the difference between lower bound of the CI with larger values and the upper bound of the CI with smaller values
    -set to 0 if CIs overlap
ci_overlap: whether 95% CIs overlap, 'Y' for yes and 'N' for no
diff_opt: whether the optimal alleles are the same for the two populations, 'Y' for yes and 'N' for no
    -two optimal alleles are considered the same if they have the same mutation rate
    -e.g. period 2 optimal allele 21 and 22 are considered the same since they both have a mutation rate of 10^-3
diff_selection: whether the locus is under differential selection, 'Y' for yes and 'N' for no
    -differential selection is defined as one locus having a p value < 0.001 and the other having a p value > 0.2
