Explanation of column headers for per-locus results

optimal_ru: number of repeat units in optimal allele (most frequent population allele length)

coding: 0.0 = noncoding locus, 1.0 = coding locus

obs_het: observed heterozygosity

ABC_s_median: median of posterior distribution of s obtained from ABC (N/A when less than 10 s accepted)

ABC_s_95%_CI: (2.5 percentile, 97.5 percentile) of posterior distribution of s obtained from ABC

Num_s_accepted: number of s values accepted from ABC

Likelihood_0: likelihood s equals 0

Likelihood_s: likelihood s equals ABC_s_median

LR: Likelihood_0/Likelihood_s

LogLR: -2ln(LR)

LRT_p_value: p value obtained using LogLR, which has a Chi-square distribution with one degree of freedom
